# JAMS-Cafe
Project JAMS cafe is a website mimicking a blog to increase interaction between the restaurant and its customers. 

# How to run
Do node app.js to run upload content page (NOTE: this is JUST for creating content). All uploaded pictures will be in the uploads folder.
To look at the rest of the site, navigate through the html files, don't use app.js.
