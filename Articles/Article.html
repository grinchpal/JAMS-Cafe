  <h1>JAMS Cafe</h1>
  <p>The convergence of websites and blogs is here. JAMS Cafe is an interactive interface that increases interaction between restaurants and their customers. Typically, websites are left underdeveloped or become very static due to lack of appeal and organization of information compared to other service apps. With our project, we hope we can create an interface to build a relationship and attraction between the two parties by keeping the site dynamic and appealing.

          <li>1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
